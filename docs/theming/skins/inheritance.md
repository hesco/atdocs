## Inheritance

- Skins inherit all Extension and Layout settings from their base theme.
- Skins inherit templates, styles (all libraries), color module settings, preprocess and alters from their base theme(s).

Note there are no Extension or Layout settings for Skins, they can only inherit these from their base theme. If you need a theme with it's own settings generate a standard Starter Kit theme.
