## Generating Skin Themes

AT Theme Generator can generate skin type themes. Generating a new skin is strait forward and only requires you to provide a name and the "base theme", which is the theme you want "skin".

If the base theme supports SCSS/Grunt etc the skin theme will automatically include a grunt file and SCSS partial for the CSS file.

The generator takes care of the info file, library and CSS file naming. The skin theme is usable strait away without any modifications to it's info or library files.

ALl you need to do is start adding your CSS declarations.
