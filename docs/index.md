# Documentation for Adaptivetheme 8.x

The documentation here is currently a work in progress. Initially the docs will cover installation, theme generation and how to setup your Extension settings and Layout. We will add docs covering the Layout Plugin layouts for use with Display Suite & Paragraph module, as well as a section on Color module enabled sub-themes.

In due course we will add developer documentation which will delve into the nuts and bolts of the theme, covering templates, Javascript and the jQuery plugins, UIKit (SCSS User Interface Kit for Drupal), the page layout system and how to build new layouts, and the inner workings of AT's rather complex asset management (libraries).
